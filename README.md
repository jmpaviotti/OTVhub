# OTVhub
Website where you can keep track of Offline TV streams through a dynamic Twitch player/chat embed. Also features a grid mode, which fits all the players to your screen.

Originally created as a project to learn HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Usage
The default dynamic mode shows a Twitch player on the left side of the screen, with the chat on the right.

If it's your first time on the site, the player's gonna show Fedmyster's channel. On following visits, the site's gonna remember which channel you last chose to watch.

The site has a hamburger menu on the top left corner, which allows you to:
- Switch to grid mode
- Hide/Show the chat
- Change player/chat channel

Additionally, the website's layout is responsive, and adapts it's features to mobile resolutions.

## Misc
### Possible features for v2.0:
As of now, there are no real plans to expand the project without porting to a framework first. Nevertheless, here's what I had in mind for a more "complete" version:

- Show who's live right now in dynamic mode menu buttons
- Facebook live integration (for DisguisedToast's stream)
- Browser notifications when streams go live
- General UI overhaul
